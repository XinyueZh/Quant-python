    "# [The balanced brackets problem](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/balanced-brackets/problem)\n",
    "A bracket is considered to be any one of the following characters: (, ), {, }, [, or ].\n",
    "\n",
    "Two brackets are considered to be a matched pair if the an opening bracket (i.e., (, [, or {) occurs to the left of a closing bracket (i.e., ), ], or }) of the exact same type. There are three types of matched pairs of brackets: [], {}, and ().\n",
    "\n",
    "A matching pair of brackets is not balanced if the set of brackets it encloses are not matched. For example, {[(])} is not balanced because the contents in between { and } are not balanced. The pair of square brackets encloses a single, unbalanced opening bracket, (, and the pair of parentheses encloses a single, unbalanced closing square bracket, ].\n",
    "\n",
    "By this logic, we say a sequence of brackets is considered to be balanced if the following conditions are met:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It contains no unmatched brackets.\n",
    "* The subset of brackets enclosed within the confines of a matched pair of brackets is also a matched pair of brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given  strings of brackets, determine whether each sequence of brackets is balanced. If a string is balanced, print YES on a new line; otherwise, print NO on a new line."
