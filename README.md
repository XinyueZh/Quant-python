# Quant-python

## Introduction
This project is a collection of short python programs I wrote during bootcamp.

## python basics
We learned about python datatypes, if-elif-else conditionals, for and while loops, lists and tuples, and list comprehensions.

Here is my [basics Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/XinyueZh/Quant-python/blob/master/python-basics-notebook.ipynb).

## python secret project
There are lots of good algorithm questions on a certain site, and here are my [solution](https://github.com/XinyueZh/Quant-python/blob/master/python-secret-notebook.ipynb).

## python interview project
There are lots of interview questions about python. Here's [some of them and my answers](https://github.com/XinyueZh/Quant-python/blob/master/python-interview-notebook4.ipynb).
